# Data Structure

## About
> - This repository contains quite brutal(?) struggles I poured into learning what data structure is.
> - I referred to and traced after some book's chapter structure and its content but mainly focused on reaching further than just fininishing the book and understanding thoroughly through reliable sources. (Wikipedia, research paper, stackoverflow etc.)
> - Therefore this is more like a personal note than a summary.
> - Even though it is, any corrections or feedback through PR would be heavily appreciated!!

## Caution!
> **The notes in this repository partially contains bunch of unverified personal opinions.**
>   - I encountered some terms and concepts which was really hard for me to understand. And some of them have been used confusingly and conflicted with others.
>     - Example: Data Structure v.s Data Type
>   - And though I did my best to draw precise conclusion and understanding on them and searched & studied on them pretty hard, I know this can never be enough and complete as I'm a noooob here and lack of comprehensive understanding in computer science. 
>   - I didn't marked my unverified personal opinion part visually, but I left them in oral format on purpose so that I or somebody who might read this in future can notice that those are just an opinion and follow how I've led to them.
>   - So just in case for somebody might read this, please keep this in your mind. :(
>   
> **Implementations for data structure in each chapter are just for understanding overall features and structure itself.**
>   - I didn't implement exception handling logic in almost every code I wrote for data structure implementation.


> **If it has already been implemented in built-in module, I dived into it and I took a note of it.**
>   - Not enough but at least I tried.
